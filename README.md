## VENTILATION PROJECT

• Control the speed of a ventilation fan
• Fan is connected to an ABB frequency
converter

– Converter is controlled using Modbus protocol

• Two operating modes:

– Manual mode

– Automatic mode

Automatic mode

• Set the pressure level in the ventilation duct (0

– 120 pa) in the UI

– Pressure level is pressure difference between the

room and the ventilation duct

• Controller measures pressure level and keeps
the level at the required setting by adjusting
the fan speed

– If required level can’t be reached within a
reasonable time user is notified on the UI
Manual mode

• Set the speed of the fan in UI (0 – 100%)

• Display current fan setting and pressure level
in the UI
